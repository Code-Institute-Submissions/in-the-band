## Bugs
1. Meet the band images were oval rather than round
    1. Fix: Found conflicting CSS content created for different sections of the website and amended this so that the CSS was under unique classes
2. I wanted the text in the footer bar to be centered vertically however, I was unable to find a simple way for this to work   
    1. Fix: I added padding to the footer to enable the text to be vertically aligned. This had the added bonus of making the footer look better as it was larger
3. Hero image on home/index.html page is not resizing correctly on smaller screens
    1. Fix: I replaced the jumbotron with a just img html rather than adding the url in the css. One side effect was that this removed the centering of the text and images in the meet the band section.
4. Images in the meet the band section are impacted as per above Bug
    1. Fix: The mtb-style class had been in the removed html of the jumbotron. Re-added this to the meet the band section.
5. Adding an embedded youtube video caused the sizing of the page to show as justified to the left. I believe this is because it made the page width bigger but this didnâ€™t apply to the other content
    1. Fix: I used the bootstrap example to simplify the code provided by youtube. This removed some of the styling elements youtube added and ensured the video was fully responsive without impacting the layout of the remainder of the page
6. The table added to display the tour dates was not fully responsive meaning the end user needed to scroll on mobile devices
    1. Fix: Rather than using a table, I recreated the content in the bootstrap grid system. The content is now responsive and wrapps appropriately so no scrolling is required
